# UEFI for Rockchip RK356X based Single Board Computers

This repository contains a port of Tianocore EDK II to various Rockchip RK356x based boards:

* [PINE64 Quartz64 Model A](https://www.pine64.org/quartz64a/) / [PINE64 Quartz64 Model B](https://www.pine64.org/quartz64b/) / [PINE64 SOQuartz](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/SOQuartz)
* [Firefly ROC-RK3566-PC](https://en.t-firefly.com/product/industry/rocrk3566pc.html) / [StationPC Station M2](https://www.stationpc.com/product/stationm2)
* [Firefly ROC-RK3568-PC](https://en.t-firefly.com/product/industry/rocrk3568pc.html) / [StationPC Station P2](https://www.stationpc.com/product/stationp2)
* [Radxa ROCK3 Computing Module](https://wiki.radxa.com/Rock3/CM3)

## Building an SD card / eMMC image

If you want to build the image, checkout the repository and run:
`$ make sdcard`

Prebuild images are also provided for stable ports and are available in the [release section](https://github.com/jaredmcneill/quartz64_uefi/releases).

**Note:** The ROCK3 Compute Module port is still work in progress: as such no prebuild images are released for those boards.

## Running

Connect a serial console to UART2 using settings `115200 8n1`.

## Operating system support

| FreeBSD | 14.0-CURRENT | ? | Mangled serial output, boot stuck waiting for random seed |
| NetBSD | 9.99.x | HDMI, USB2, USB3, serial, SD card, PCIe, eMMC, SATA, ethernet, thermal sensors, watchdog | |
| OpenBSD | 7.0-current | HDMI, USB2, USB3, serial | To use HDMI console, enter `set tty fb0` at the bootloader prompt. |
| Ubuntu | 21.04 | HDMI, USB2, USB3, serial, PCIe, thermal sensors | Needs `irqchip.gicv3_nolpi=1` for MSI support |
| Windows PE | ? | HDMI, USB3, PCIe | BSOD when plugging device in to USB2 port (#2) |

## eMMC controller Device-Specific Method (_DSM)

The divider register in the RK356x's SDHCI controller does not work, so to change the eMMC card clock we have to do it through the CRU. This is exposed to the OS as an ACPI Device-Specific Method (_DSM).

### Function 1: Set Card Clock

The _DSM control method parameters for the Set Card Clock function are as follows:

#### Arguments

 - **Arg0**: UUID = 434addb0-8ff3-49d5-a724-95844b79ad1f
 - **Arg1**: Revision = 0
 - **Arg2**: Function Index = 1
 - **Arg3**: Target card clock rate in Hz.

#### Return

The actual card clock rate in Hz. Will be less than or equal to the target clock rate. Returns 0 if the target clock rate could not be set.
